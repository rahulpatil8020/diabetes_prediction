# Diabetes Prediction Using LightGBM Machine Learning Algorithm 
- This project is basically prediction of diabetes on some parameters like glucose level, insulin level, BMI, etc.
- The LightGBM (Light Gradient Boost Machine) Algorithm is used to get the accuracy of around 89%.
- It's deployed using Heroku. (Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.)


###-- Project Status: Completed


## Project Intro/Objective
   It is observed that Machine Learning is very Promising in Medical Field. From Detecting Tumour using CNNs to predicting Heart Attack it has many applications in medical fields.
Diabetes Prediction is another use of machine learning where with the help of some parameters like glucose level, insulin level, BMI, etc. we can predict if the person has diabetes and around 89% of the time the prediction is Accurate using LightGBM and tunning the hyper-parameters using GridSearch.

## Project Description


## Needs of this project

- frontend developers
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
- etc. (be as specific as possible)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
