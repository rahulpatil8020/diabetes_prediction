# [Diabetes Prediction Using LightGBM Machine Learning Algorithm](https://diabetesdetection-api.herokuapp.com/)
- This project is basically prediction of diabetes on some parameters like glucose level, insulin level, BMI, etc.
- The LightGBM (Light Gradient Boost Machine) Algorithm is used to get the accuracy of around 89%.
- It's deployed using Heroku. (Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.)


## Project Introduction
   It is observed that Machine Learning is very Promising in Medical Field. From Detecting Tumour using CNNs to predicting Heart Attack it has many applications in medical fields.
Diabetes Prediction is another use of machine learning where with the help of some parameters like glucose level, insulin level, BMI, etc. we can predict if the person has diabetes and around 89% of the time the prediction is Accurate using LightGBM and tunning the hyper-parameters using GridSearch.
